# Autonomous Surveillance System

This project presents an autonomous surveillance system designed to address the critical need for security measures, particularly in high-risk environments such as jail facilities. The system utilizes Arduino UNO for sensor control, motor drivers, and ESP8266 for movement, along with various sensors for motion detection and laser guidance.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust surveillance system capable of autonomously monitoring and detecting any unauthorized activities within a designated area. By combining advanced sensor technology with precise movement control, the system aims to enhance security measures and minimize the risk of breaches in sensitive environments.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino UNO: Utilized for sensor control and interfacing with various components.
- ESP8266: Integrated for movement control and communication capabilities.
- Motor drivers: Employed for controlling the movement of surveillance components.
- Sensors: Incorporates motion detection sensors for detecting intrusions.
- Laser guidance: Implemented for precise targeting and tracking of suspicious activities.

## Features

- Autonomous surveillance: The system operates independently, continuously monitoring the designated area for any suspicious activities.
- Motion detection: Utilizes advanced sensors to detect motion within the surveillance zone.
- Precise movement control: ESP8266 enables precise movement of surveillance components, ensuring optimal coverage.
- Laser guidance: Incorporates laser guidance for accurate targeting and tracking of detected intrusions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/surveillance-system.git
```

2. Set up the Arduino UNO and ESP8266 according to the provided schematics and connections.

3. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino UNO board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.

4. Ensure that all sensors and components are properly connected and calibrated.

5. Power on the system and initiate the surveillance mode.

## Usage

1. Once the system is powered on and initialized, it will begin monitoring the designated area autonomously.

2. Any detected motion or suspicious activities will trigger the appropriate response, such as activating the laser guidance or sending alerts.

3. Monitor the system's operation and make any necessary adjustments to optimize performance.

## Configuration

- Modify the Arduino code to adjust settings such as sensor sensitivity, movement patterns, and response mechanisms.
